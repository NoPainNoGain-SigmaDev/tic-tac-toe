# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe

A basic but functional implementation of Tic Tac Toe where players can input their names, play rounds, and see the winner displayed.

The goal of the project was to use **as little global code as possible**, using **factories** and **encapsulation** for clean and modular JavaScript structure.
